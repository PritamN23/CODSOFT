				The symbol of knowledge
			</h1>
			<p>
				☛ Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University and the London School of Economics,
                receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively,and was among a handful of Indian
                students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London.
                In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer.<br><br>

				☛As Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda,he was bound to serve it.
                He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time.
                He described the incident in his autobiography, Waiting for a Visa.
                Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family.He worked as a private tutor,
                as an accountant,and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned 
                that he was an untouchable.<br><br>
				
                ☛ Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the Southborough Committee,
                which was preparing the Government of India Act 1919. At this hearing, Ambedkar argued for creating 
                separate electorates and reservations for untouchables and other religious communities.In 1920,
                he began the publication of the weekly Mooknayak (Leader of the Silent) in Mumbai with the help of Shahu of Kolhapur,
                that is, Shahu IV (1874–1922)..<br><br>

				☛ Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders
                who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel.
                Dhananjay Keer notes, "The victory was resounding, both socially and individually,
                for the clients and the doctor".<br><br>
                
                ☛ While practising law in the Bombay High Court, he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift them.
                His first organised attempt was his establishment of the central institution Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha,
                intended to promote education and socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of "outcastes",
                at the time referred to as depressed classes For the defence of Dalit rights, he started many periodicals
                like Mook Nayak, Bahishkrit Bharat, and Equality Janta.<br><br> 

                ☛ He was appointed to the Bombay Presidency Committee to work with the all-European Simon Commission in 1925.
                This commission had sparked great protests across India, and while its report was ignored by most Indians,
                Ambedkar himself wrote a separate set of recommendations for the future Constitution of India
				<br><br> 
                
                ☛By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against untouchability. He began with public movements
                and marches to open up public drinking water resources. He also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples.
                He led a satyagraha in Mahad to fight for the right of the untouchable community to draw water from the main
                water tank of the town.In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text,
                the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and "untouchability",
                and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text. On 25 December 1927, he led thousands of followers
                to burn copies of Manusmriti.Thus annually 25 December is celebrated as <strong>Manusmriti Dahan Din</strong>
                (Manusmriti Burning Day) by Ambedkarites and Dalits.

                <h3></h3><strong>Drafting of India's Constitution</strong></h3><br><br>
			
                
                ☛ Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru invited Ambedkar
                to serve as the Dominion of India's Law Minister; two weeks later, he was appointed Chairman of the Drafting
                Committee of the Constitution for the future Republic of India.
				<br><br> 
                
                ☛ On 25 November 1949, Ambedkar in his concluding speech in constituent assembly said:
                <strong>"The credit that is given to me does not really belong to me. It belongs partly to Sir B.N. Rau the
                  Constitutional Advisor to the Constituent Assembly who prepared a rough draft of the Constitution for the
                  consideration of the Drafting Committee."</strong>
				<br><br> 
                
                ☛ Indian constitution guarantees and protections for a wide range of civil liberties for individual citizens,
                including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination.
                Ambedkar was one of the ministers who argued for extensive economic and social rights for women,
                and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of reservations of jobs in the civil services,
                schools and colleges for members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Other Backward Class,
                a system akin to affirmative action. India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities
                and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures.The Constitution was
                adopted on 26 November 1949 by the Constituent Assembly.
				<br><br> 
                
                ☛ Ambedkar expressed his disapproval for the constitution in 1953 during a parliament session and said
                "People always keep on saying to me "Oh you are the maker of the constitution". My answer is I was a hack.
                What I was asked to do, I did much against my will." Ambedkar added that, "I am quite prepared to say that
                I shall be the first person to burn it out. I do not want it. It does not suit anybody."
				<br><br> 
                
                <h3></h3><strong>Conversion to Buddhism</strong></h3><br><br>
                
                ☛ Ambedkar considered converting to Sikhism, which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to
                leaders of scheduled castes. But after meeting with Sikh leaders, he concluded that he might get "second-rate"
                Sikh status.
				<br><br> 
                
                ☛ Instead, around 1950, he began devoting his attention to Buddhism and travelled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)
                to attend a meeting of the World Fellowship of Buddhists.While dedicating a new Buddhist vihara near Pune,
                Ambedkar announced he was writing a book on Buddhism, and that when it was finished, he would formally convert
                to Buddhism.[87] He twice visited Burma in 1954
				<br><br> 
                
                ☛After meetings with the Sri Lankan Buddhist monk Hammalawa Saddhatissa,
                <strong>Ambedkar organised a formal public ceremony for himself and his supporters in Nagpur on 14 October 1956</strong>
                .Accepting the Three Refuges and Five Precepts from a Buddhist monk in the traditional manner,
                Ambedkar completed his own conversion, along with his wife. He then proceeded to convert some 500,000 of his
                supporters who were gathered around him.He prescribed the 22 Vows for these converts, after the Three Jewels
                and Five Precepts. He then travelled to Kathmandu, Nepal to attend the Fourth World Buddhist Conference.
                His work on The Buddha or Karl Marx and "Revolution and counter-revolution in ancient India" remained incomplete.
				<br><br> 
                
                ☛ Ambedkar was voted "the Greatest Indian" since independence by a poll organised by History TV18 and CNN IBN,
                ahead of Patel and Nehru, in 2012. Nearly 20 million votes were cast.Due to his role in economics,
                Narendra Jadhav, a notable Indian economist,has said that Ambedkar was "the highest educated Indian
                economist of all times."Amartya Sen, said that Ambedkar is "father of my economics", and "he was highly
                controversial figure in his home country, though it was not the reality. His contribution in the field of
                economics is marvelous and will be remembered forever."
